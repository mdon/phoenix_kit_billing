defmodule PhoenixKit.Modules.Billing do
  # Temporary compatibility alias for PhoenixKitBilling.
  #
  # This module exists to maintain backward compatibility with PhoenixKit core
  # which still references the old `PhoenixKit.Modules.Billing.*` namespace.
  # Will be removed once core is fully migrated to `PhoenixKitBilling.*`.
  #
  # All public functions are explicitly delegated to PhoenixKitBilling. Hidden
  # from HexDocs because consumers should target `PhoenixKitBilling.*` directly.
